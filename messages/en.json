    "title": "A Healing Touch",
    "p1": "When my hands touch a client's back, I first locate any tense muscles or knots. I don't follow a single technique — instead, I communicate with the body through my senses to understand what each client truly needs.",
    "p2": "First, I work to release tension and dissolve the knots. Then, I go deeper — using intuition and touch to quiet the mind and restore balance to the whole body."

  "story": {
    "title": "My Story",
    "p1": "My journey into massage began long before any formal training. As a child, I watched my grandmother — a midwife — massage pregnant women with care and confidence. She was my first mentor. Later, my godfather taught me the art of cupping and acupuncture, deepening my connection to traditional healing.",
    "p2": "Wanting to expand my skills, I enrolled in a specialized massage school and later trained at an academy in Utrecht, where I studied Swedish massage techniques. When I first arrived from China, I was struck by the kindness of the Dutch — their patience in teaching someone still finding her way in a new country.",
    "p3": "Those experiences shaped who I am today: a therapist who blends Eastern intuition with Western technique, guided always by what the body asks for."

  "phoenix": {
    "title": "Why \"Phoenix\"?",
    "p1": "The phoenix represents resurrection and rebirth — rising from the ashes, transformed and renewed. That is exactly what I want for every client who walks through my door: to arrive weary, and to leave feeling reborn.",
    "p2": "That's why I named this place Phoenix."
